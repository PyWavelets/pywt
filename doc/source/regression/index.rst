The examples in this section are written in the `MyST markdown notebook format`_. This allows
each .md file to function simultaneously as documentation that can be fed into
Sphinx and as a source file that can be converted to the Jupyter notebook format
(.ipynb), which can then be opened in notebook applications such as JupyterLab.
For this reason, each example page in this folder includes a header template
that adds a blurb to the top of each page about how the page can be run or
downloaded as a Jupyter notebook. This is explained in greater detail in the
`regression folder README`_.

For more usage examples see the `demo`_ directory in the source package.
