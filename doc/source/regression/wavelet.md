# The Wavelet object

## Wavelet families and builtin Wavelets names

{class}`Wavelet` objects are really a handy carriers of a bunch of DWT-specific
data like _quadrature mirror filters_ and some general properties associated
with them.

At first let's go through the methods of creating a {class}`Wavelet` object.
The easiest and the most convenient way is to use builtin named Wavelets.

These wavelets are organized into groups called wavelet families. The most
commonly used families are:

```{code-cell}
import pywt
pywt.families()
```

The {func}`wavelist` function with family name passed as an argument is used to
obtain the list of wavelet names in each family.

```{code-cell}
for family in pywt.families():
    print("%s family: " % family + ', '.join(pywt.wavelist(family)))
```

To get the full list of builtin wavelets' names, just use the {func}`wavelist`
without any arguments.

## Creating Wavelet objects

Now, since we know all the names, let's finally create a {class}`Wavelet` object:

```{code-cell}
w = pywt.Wavelet('db3')
```

and, that's it!

## Wavelet properties

But what can we do with {class}`Wavelet` objects? Well, they carry some
interesting pieces of information.

First, let's try printing a {class}`Wavelet` object that we used earlier.
This shows a brief information about its name, its family name and some
properties like orthogonality and symmetry.

```{code-cell}
print(w)
```

But the most important bits of information are the wavelet filters coefficients,
which are used in {ref}`Discrete Wavelet Transform <ref-dwt>`. These coefficients
can be obtained via the {attr}`~Wavelet.dec_lo`, {attr}`Wavelet.dec_hi`,
{attr}`~Wavelet.rec_lo` and {attr}`~Wavelet.rec_hi` attributes, which
correspond to lowpass & highpass decomposition filters and lowpass &
highpass reconstruction filters respectively:

```{code-cell}
def print_array(arr):
    print("[%s]" % ", ".join(["%.14f" % x for x in arr]))
```

Another way to get the filters data is to use the {attr}`~Wavelet.filter_bank`
attribute, which returns all four filters in a tuple:

```{code-cell}
w.filter_bank == (w.dec_lo, w.dec_hi, w.rec_lo, w.rec_hi)
```

Other properties of a `Wavelet` object are:

1. Wavelet {attr}`~Wavelet.name`, {attr}`~Wavelet.short_family_name` and {attr}`~Wavelet.family_name`:

```{code-cell}
print(w.name)
print(w.short_family_name)
print(w.family_name)
```

2. Decomposition ({attr}`~Wavelet.dec_len`) and reconstruction ({attr}`~.Wavelet.rec_len`) filter lengths:

<!-- # int() is for normalizing longs and ints for doctest -->
<!-- TODO: FIXME: note: might not be needed anymore -->

```{code-cell}
int(w.dec_len)
```

```{code-cell}
int(w.rec_len)
```

3. Orthogonality ({attr}`~Wavelet.orthogonal`) and biorthogonality ({attr}`~Wavelet.biorthogonal`):

```{code-cell}
w.orthogonal
```

```{code-cell}
w.biorthogonal
```

3. Symmetry ({attr}`~Wavelet.symmetry`):

```{code-cell}
print(w.symmetry)
```

4. Number of vanishing moments for the scaling function `phi` ({attr}`~Wavelet.vanishing_moments_phi`)
   and the wavelet function `psi` ({attr}`~Wavelet.vanishing_moments_psi`), associated with the filters:

```{code-cell}
 w.vanishing_moments_phi
```

```{code-cell}
w.vanishing_moments_psi
```

Now when we know a bit about the builtin Wavelets, let's see how to create
{ref}`custom Wavelets <custom-wavelets>` objects. These can be done in two ways:

1. Passing the filter bank object that implements the `filter_bank` attribute. The
   attribute must return four filters coefficients.

```{code-cell}
class MyHaarFilterBank(object):
    @property
    def filter_bank(self):
        from math import sqrt
        return (
          [sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2], [-sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2],
          [sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2], [sqrt(2)/2, -sqrt(2)/2]
        )
```

and let's put this in action:

```{code-cell}
my_wavelet = pywt.Wavelet('My Haar Wavelet', filter_bank=MyHaarFilterBank())
```

2. Passing the filters coefficients directly as the `filter_bank` parameter.

```{code-cell}
from math import sqrt
my_filter_bank = (
  [sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2], [-sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2],
  [sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2], [sqrt(2)/2, -sqrt(2)/2]
)
my_wavelet = pywt.Wavelet('My Haar Wavelet', filter_bank=my_filter_bank)
```

Note that such custom wavelets **will not** have all the properties set
to correct values and some of them could be missing:

```{code-cell}
print(my_wavelet)
```

You can, however, set a couple of them on your own:

```{code-cell}
my_wavelet.orthogonal = True
my_wavelet.biorthogonal = True
```

Let's view the values of the custom wavelet properties again:

```{code-cell}
print(my_wavelet)
```

## And now... the `wavefun`!

We all know that the fun with wavelets is in wavelet functions.
Now, what would be this package without a tool to compute wavelet
and scaling functions approximations?

This is the purpose of the {meth}`~Wavelet.wavefun` method, which is used to
approximate scaling function (`phi`) and wavelet function (`psi`) at the
given level of refinement, based on the filters coefficients.

The number of returned values varies depending on the wavelet's
orthogonality property. For orthogonal wavelets, the result is a tuple
with the scaling function, wavelet function, and the xgrid coordinates.

```{code-cell}
w = pywt.Wavelet('sym3')
w.orthogonal
```

```{code-cell}
(phi, psi, x) = w.wavefun(level=5)
```

For biorthogonal (non-orthogonal) wavelets, different scaling and wavelet
functions are used for decomposition and reconstruction, and thus, five
elements are returned: decomposition scaling & wavelet functions
approximations, reconstruction scaling & wavelet functions approximations,
and the xgrid.

```{code-cell}
w = pywt.Wavelet('bior1.3')
w.orthogonal
```

```{code-cell}
(phi_d, psi_d, phi_r, psi_r, x) = w.wavefun(level=5)
```

:::{seealso}
You can find live examples of the usage of {meth}`~Wavelet.wavefun` and
images of all the built-in wavelets on the
[Wavelet Properties Browser](http://wavelets.pybytes.com) page.

However, **this website is no longer actively maintained** and does not
include every wavelet present in PyWavelets. The precision of the wavelet
coefficients at that site is also lower than those included in PyWavelets.
