PyWavelets 1.9.0 Release Notes
==============================

We are very pleased to announce the release of PyWavelets 1.9.0. This release
contains a fix for a long-standing problem with ``pywt.cwt``, adding a
``precision`` keyword and increasing the default precision used.

This release makes a number of changes to the versions of dependencies that are
supported:

- Support for Python 3.14 is added, and support for Python 3.10 dropped,
- The minimum supported NumPy version is now 1.25.0,
- The optional dependency on SciPy has been removed,
