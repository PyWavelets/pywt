PyWavelets 1.8.0 Release Notes
==============================

We are very pleased to announce the release of PyWavelets 1.8.0. This release
is a minor update to 1.7.x. It adds support for free-threaded Python 3.13 on
Windows. The supported Python, NumPy and Cython versions are unchanged from
1.7.x.

Note that building from source with free-threaded CPython requires a recent
development version of Cython (>=3.1.0a0).
