==============================
PyWavelets 1.0.2 Release Notes
==============================

PyWavelets 1.0.2 is a bug-fix and maintenance release with no new features
compared to 1.0.1.

Bugs Fixed
==========

A bug in `iswtn` when using some combinations of user-specified axes was fixed.

A potential error related to coefficient shape mismatch during WaveletPacket
or WaveletPacket2D reconstruction was fixed.

Other Changes
=============

A deprecated import of ``Iterable`` was fixed.

The spelling of "Garrote" was fixed in the wavelet thresholding documentation.
For backwards compatibility with 1.0.0, the incorrect ("garotte")
spelling is also accepted for the ``mode`` parameter of ``pywt.threshold``.

The spelling of "supported" was fixed in one of the ValueError messages that
can be returned by ``pywt.cwt``.

Cython language compatibility has been pinned to ``language_level = '2'``. This
is in contrast to the `master` branch which is now using
``language_level = '3'``. To support this, the minimum supported Cython version
has been raised to 0.23.5.
