==============================
PyWavelets 1.0.1 Release Notes
==============================

PyWavelets 1.0.1 is a bug-fix release with no new features compared to 1.0.0.


Bugs Fixed
==========

Key-based assignment of coefficients to a ``FswavedecnResult`` object (i.e. via
its __setitem__ method) has been fixed.

The order that the individual subband coefficients were stacked by the
function ``pywt.ravel_coeffs`` is now guaranteed to be consistent across all
supported Python versions. Explicit alphabetic ordering of subband coefficient
names is used for consitent ordering regardless of Python version.
