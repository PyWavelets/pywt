==============================
PyWavelets 0.4.0 Release Notes
==============================

.. contents::

PyWavelets 0.4.0 is the culmination of XX months of work.  In addition to
several new features some changes and deprecations have been made to streamline
the API.

This release requires Python 2.6, 2.7 or 3.3-3.5 and NumPy 1.6.2 or greater.

Highlights of this release include:

.. TODO


New features
============

1D and 2D stationary wavelet transforms
---------------------------------------
1D (``iswt``) and 2D (``iswt2``) stationary wavelet transforms were added.
These currently only support even length inputs


Faster 2D and nD wavelet transforms
-----------------------------------
The multidimensional DWT and IDWT code was refactored and is now an order of
magnitude faster than in previous releases.  The following functions benefit:
``dwt2``, ``idwt2``, ``dwtn``, ``idwtn``.


Complex floating point support
------------------------------
64 and 128-bit complex data types are now supported by all wavelet transforms.


nD implementation of the multilevel DWT and IDWT
------------------------------------------------
The existing 1D and 2D multilevel transforms were supplemented with an nD
implementation.


Wavelet transforms can be applied along a specific axis/axes
------------------------------------------------------------
All wavelet transform functions now support explicit specification of the axis
or axes upon which to perform the transform.


Deprecated features
===================

A number of functions have been renamed, the old names are deprecated and will
be removed in a future release:

- ``intwave``, renamed to ``integrate_wavelet``
- ``centrfrq``, renamed to ``central_frequency``
- ``scal2frq``, renamed to ``scale2frequency``
- ``orthfilt``, renamed to ``orthogonal_filter_bank``

Integration of general signals (i.e. not wavelets) with ``integrate_wavelet``
is deprecated.

The ``MODES`` object and its attributes are deprecated.  The new name is
``Modes``, and the attribute names are expanded:

- ``zpd``, renamed to ``zero``
- ``cpd``, renamed to ``constant``
- ``sp1``, renamed to ``smooth``
- ``sym``, renamed to ``symmetric``
- ``ppd``, renamed to ``periodic``
- ``per``, renamed to ``periodization``

Backwards incompatible changes
==============================

``idwt`` no longer takes a ``correct_length`` parameter. As a consequence,
``idwt2`` inputs must match exactly in length. For multilevel transforms, where
arrays differing in size by one element may be produced, use the ``waverec``
functions from the ``multilevel`` module instead.

Bugs Fixed
==========

float32 inputs were not always respected. All transforms now return float32
outputs when called using float32 inputs.

incorrect detail coefficients were returned by downcoef when level > 1

Other changes
